# Discord.Js-Bot-Basics

Hello friends this is my first repo and today i'm just showing he basics of discord bot coding (Javascript) . SO LETS GET STARTED !!! 

At first you should install the below things ! 
-> NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-> Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

I made some bat files for downloading modules so it will be useful to beginners ! So first download these files as zip and extract it. 

So first open our folder . And if u wanna add/edit commands you can do it by opening index.js in VSCode. 

Then goto Discord Developers Portal . (https://discord.com/developers/applications)

Make an application. Add bot . Turn on Presence Intent and Server Members Intent . Then go to OAuth2 select bot and invite bot .

Then copy your bot token .

Open config.json in our folder.

Replace YOUR BOT TOKEN with your token that you have copied from Discord Developers Portal.
And replace YOUR PREFIX with a prefix of your wish.

Then you can start your bot by clicking start.bat. 

For help you can join (https://discord.gg/cSkusSBJ8U) here .
